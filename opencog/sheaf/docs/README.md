This directory contains an alternative, more rigorous, more precise
description of what the code below is all about. Its under construction
and very incomplete, just right now.

There are several files here:
* The [sheaves.pdf](sheaves.pdf) file. It is long; over 60 pages. The
  source for this PDF is is `sheaves.lyx`. It can be edited with the LyX
  typesetting application.

* The [connectors-and-variables.pdf](connectors-and-variables.pdf) file.
  It is complementary to the above, repeating some material. It is meant to
  provide a more detailed footing. To avoid a snowball of ever-increaing
  length, it is split into bite-sized chapters. The chapters are currently,
  in serial order:

** [mereology.pdf](mereology.pdf) discusses the relationship of the
   connector-and-sheaf viewpoint to the philosophical notions of mereology
   and postmodernism.

** [tensors.pdf](tensors.pdf) defines a generalized tensor as an algebraic
   object. It is meant to formalize earlier statements, while still being
   readable and approachable.
