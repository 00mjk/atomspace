\begin_layout Title
Mereology and Postmodernism

\begin_layout Abstract
Almost all work on logic, symbolic reasoning, indeed, most of mathematics,
 is built on the intuitive foundation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

variables
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that map between them.
 There is an alternative viewpoint: that of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is developed extensively in the accompanying texts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This chapter focuses on how connectors have an impact on a number of philosophic
al arguments, ranging from mereology to postmodernism(!) This is a surprise
 (to this author, a novice at philosophy.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Philosophy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a hint of how pervasively important the concept of variables and
 values can be.
 Some philosophers use these notions to anchor the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

An object is anything that can be the value of a variable, that is, anything
 we can talk about using pronouns, that is, anything.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This conception of an object then leads to confused discussions about the
 identity of indiscernibles, and the importance of location (space-time)
 in mereology.
 The notion of connectors can be used as an alternate foundation for the
 conception of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

identity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Specifically, one can instead define objects as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things that can participate in relationships
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mereology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paradoxes of mereology were touched on in the previous section: the
 difficulty of defining part-whole relationships in a consistent manner,
 the problem of the existence or non-existence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and even the puzzles from Ancient Greece (the Ship of Theseus, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.) One proposed solution to these riddles is the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

restricted composition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see Wikipedia).
 The idea is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are still composed of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but the manner in which these can be composed is restricted.
 The body of ideas is very nearly identical to the concept of sheaves.
 Quoting directly from the Wikipedia article on mereology, we can can learn
 that these are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Contact—that a complex object Y is composed of X's if and only if the X's
 are in contact.
 
\emph on
viz.
 
\emph default
seeds attach only if they can be connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fastenation—the X's compose a complex Y if and only if the X's are fastened.
 
\emph on
viz.

\emph default
 seeds attach only if the connectors allow mating.
 Once mated, they are fastened together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cohesion—the X's compose a complex Y if and only if the X's cohere (cannot
 be pulled apart or moved in relation to each other without breaking).
 The point of connectors is that they are not meant to be pulled apart,
 once mated.
 Insofar as the above abstract definition of a sheaf failed to appeal to
 and forced order of the connectors, or to the length of the edges, the
 concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

movement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remains incomplete
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This can be repaired in a variety of ways.
 In practical applications, it is convenient to order the edges, and to
 give them weights.
 These weights can sometimes act as distances, e.g.
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional space.
 Furthermore, the branch of mathematics known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

algebraic topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is very highly developed, and can provide very explicit and concrete statements
 about the structure of space.
 For example, the dimensionality of the embedding of the network is given
 by the degree of the largest simplicial complex in the network.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fusion—the X's compose a complex Y if and only if the X's are fused (fusion
 is when the X's are joined together such that there is no boundary).
 Connectors, once connected, serve no further purpose, and are discarded.
 What mattered was the bond that was made.
 In this sense, the bonds are the fusion of connectors.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is reminiscent of Derridas statement that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deconstruction is not analysis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 One cannot break up meaning into atomic parts; there are no self-sufficient
 atomic parts of meaning.
 Meaning derives only from the fusion of words into text and into language.

\begin_layout Itemize
Brutal Composition—"It's just the way things are." There is no true, nontrivial,
 and finitely long answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last point is perhaps the most interesting notion coming out of restricted
 composition.
 It is not an ingredient, it is rather a consequence.
 If one abandons the explicit DAGs of partial orders, one then also abandons
 the notion of logical predicates and truth assignments.
 One no longer arranges logical connectives into a tree structure, or even
 into Horn clauses.
 The network, rather, represents things 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

as they are
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is not to deny predicate logic, or Boolean satisfiability: these are
 tremendously useful concepts.
 Rather, this is to avoid the symbol grounding problem (ref Wikipedia, again).
 By discarding the arrow from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signifier
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

significand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one can no longer peer into the gaping chasm of the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what does this symbol mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is very much in line with theories of postmodernism and deconstruction
 evident in the works of Derrida,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The différance of Derrida can be seen as a rejection of the linguistic equivalen
t of mereological nihilism: there is no infinite regression of looking up
 the meanings of words in a dictionary.

\end_inset

 Deleuze, Lyotard.
 There is no difference between appearance and true form; the difference
 is undecidable.
 The constructed network of connections and relations is all there is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following sections, the sheaf construction will be used as a tool
 to create A(G)I representations of reality.
 Whether the constructed network is an accurate representation of reality
 is undecidable, and this is true even in a narrow formal sense.
 Famously, it is known that the question of whether two different presentations
 of a (group-theoretical) group refer to the same group is undecidable,
 in the computational sense: there is no algorithm, guaranteed to terminate
 in finite time, that is capable of making this decision.
 This is the undecidability problem in group theory.
 That this result carries over into the fullness of a network built from
 a sheaf should come as no surprise: the presentation of a group is little
 more than a certain collection of labeled vertexes and edges (the group
 elements and the group operations) and decidability requires the graph-rewritin
g of these into a different form.
 There are no graph rewrite rules that can always bring two different presentati
ons into normal form.
 Oddly enough, such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

received wisdom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from mathematics can be used as a foundational cornerstone for post-modernism.
 This is unexpected.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Despite this, sheaves are still somehow fundamentally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

structuralist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not post-structuralist.
 The bonds are relational, in the end.
 There is always still a predicate: either an edge exists, or it doesn't.
 To every graph there is a corresponding adjacency matrix, populated with
 zeroes and ones.
 Fortunately, one can wriggle ones way out if this, by assigning numerical
 weights to edges, making some probable and some improbable.
 Whether true and false can be replaced by a subobject classifier in this
 context is perhaps a step too far, but perhaps also an interesting step.
