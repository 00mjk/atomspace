\begin_layout Abstract
Extracted subsection from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Connectors and Variables
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In elementary mathematics, it is commonplace to speak of a variable, such
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and functions of that variable, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 The power of this abstraction is that variables can be assigned a value,
 and that value can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugged into
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a function.
 For example, one asserts that 
\begin_inset Formula $x=42$
\end_inset

 and then ponders 
\begin_inset Formula $f(42)$
\end_inset

.
 This act of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugging in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is formally called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta reduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This process of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugging in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be compared to the process of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connecting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for example, connecting together two jigsaw-puzzle pieces.
 When mating together connectors, one typically has a matched pair that
 can be mated: a plug that can be plugged into a socket.
 It should be clear that beta reduction is a special case of this: that
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

socket
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into which values can be plugged into.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This observation seems nearly trivial; it is so painfully obvious that one
 wonders what more can be said.
 Yet there are tremendous consequences that arise from this, consequences
 that are in some sense equally trivial and obvious.
 That something is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is perhaps an indicator that it is important.
 This note dwells on these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ideas, and demonstrates their importance.
 The problem with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviousness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that it frames all manner of thinking: it is Aristotle's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formal cause
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, applied to thinking.
 It is provides a normative framework in which all conversation takes place.
 Design and thinking happen in the foreground; there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

figure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ground
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and anything that is obvious falls into the background, becomes implicit,
 and serves as a barrier to further thought and examination.
 Thus, the impetus for this note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Tensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of what has been said above can be made slightly more precise with
 the aid of mathematical notation.
 This section reviews the concept of a tensor, starting from its most narrow
 form, and broadening it to a general setting.
 It is hoped that the reader already knows what a tensor is, as otherwise,
 most of this may seem pointless.
 The explanation begins very simply, at the freshman level; do not be mislead
 by the simplicity, there are a few tricks in here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four properties of tensors will be exposed and articulated.
 These may seem strange and idiosyncratic, if you already know what a tensor
 is; but communicating the strangeness is why we write.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A means of storing data in a particular form or shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The tensor product as a kind of concatenation and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Types and fibers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These properties can be taken in contrast to conventional expositions, which
 emphasizes multi-linearity and and behavior under change-of-basis.
 The change in focus is required to build the abstract notion of a tensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Tensors as databases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conventional definition of a tensor in science and engineering starts
 with the introduction of the concept of a scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

: a single number usually taken to be a real number or a complex number
 or even, abstractly, taken from some ring 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 A vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\left[v_{1},v_{2},\cdots,v_{n}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a sequence of numbers.
 A matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M=\left[M\right]=M_{ij}=M(i,j)$
\end_inset

 is a square of numbers, indexed by rows and columns 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

.
 The equality signs here just suggest different ways (different notations)
 of writing the same thing.
 A 3-tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ijk}=T(i,j,k)$
\end_inset

 is a cube of numbers; a 4-tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ijkm}=T(i,j,k,m)$
\end_inset

 is a 4-dimensional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hypercube
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of numbers, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That tensors can be used to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

store data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sounds a bit silly, or perhaps painfully obvious, given the conventional
 definition.
 None-the-less, tensors are a form of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

database
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the number) has been 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stored
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 determined by the indexes (which are taken as ordinal numbers).
 This becomes a slightly more interesting observation when one realizes
 that computer-science has a small armada of similar devices for storing
 data: arrays and vectors and lists and lookup tables and the like.
 In comp-sci, considerations such as speed, space, accessibility, mutability
 become important, and strongly affect algorithms.
 That a tensor has the form of a database becomes even more interesting
 when one ponders how to store extremely sparse tensors: those whose entries
 are mostly zero, with a scattering of non-zero entries.
 Consider a matrix with one million rows and one million columns: this has
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}\times10^{6}=10^{12}$
\end_inset

 locations; were we to splat a 64-bit floating-point number down at each
 location, this would require 
\begin_inset Formula $8\times10^{12}$
\end_inset

 bytes of storage: 8 terabytes.
 If all of those locations were zero, except for possibly for 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 here or there ...
 that would be an insane waste of RAM: storing a million non-zero numbers
 requires only 8 megabytes, not 8 terabytes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sparse tensors, the preferred storage mechanism takes the form of a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, already illustrated in a figure above.
 Lets repeat it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename graphics/seed-unlabelled.eps
	lyxscale 60
	width 25col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The black dot at the center is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the number).
 The white dots are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tensor indexes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – the ordinal-number valued tuple identifying the location of the data.
 The figure shows five connectors, and thus an entry in a 5-tensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Tensor products
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with the conventional definition of the tensor product, before
 generalizing it in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tensor product is conventionally denoted with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

otimes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

.
 This intimidating symbol is used to emphasize the multi-linearity of the
 tensor product.
 That is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 are vectors, and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are constant numbers, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(au+bv\right)\otimes w=au\otimes w+bv\otimes w
\]

\end_inset

for the left side of the product, and likewise for the right: that this
 works on both sides is what makes it multi-linear.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 symbol is required because the Cartesian product symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 does not work, it is not multi-linear.
 Consider, for example, the two ordered pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $u\times w=\left(u,w\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v\times w=\left(v,w\right)$
\end_inset

.
 How can we multiply a scalar times an ordered pair? Conventionally, one
 re-scales all of the components.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $a.\left(u,w\right)=\left(a.u,a.w\right)$
\end_inset

 but this fails spectacularly in terms of multi-linearity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a.\left(u,w\right)+b.\left(v,w\right)=\left(a.u,a.w\right)+\left(b.v,b.w\right)=\left(au+bv,aw+bw\right)\ne\left(au+bv,w\right)
\]

\end_inset

The tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 is not the Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tensor products as equivalence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tensor product can be constructed from the Cartesian product by declaring
 an equivalence.
 From the multi-linearity property above, it's clear that we wish to say
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $au\times w$
\end_inset

 is the same thing as 
\begin_inset Formula $u\times aw$
\end_inset

.
 That is, we already have defined the tensor product so that 
\begin_inset Formula $au\otimes w=u\otimes aw$
\end_inset

 as strict equality; yet this is patently false for ordinary ordered pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure to rectify this situation is to introduce a new notion of
 equivalence.
 Using the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 to denote 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same as
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $au\times w\sim u\times aw$
\end_inset

.
 The usual laws of algebra should apply, so subtraction can be used to bring
 everything over to one side: 
\begin_inset Formula $au\times w-u\times aw\sim0$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the difference of these two ordered pairs is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same as
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 zero.
 Switching notation for ordered pairs, one may write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(au,w\right)-\left(u,aw\right)\sim0$
\end_inset

.
 The algebra is meant to behave 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

as expected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(au,w\right)-\left(u,aw\right)=\left(au-u,w-aw\right)=\left(\left(a-1\right)u,\left(1-a\right)w\right)\sim0
\]

\end_inset

But 
\begin_inset Formula $a-1$
\end_inset

 is just a number 
\begin_inset Formula $c=a-1$
\end_inset

, so the above says 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(cu,-cw\right)\sim0
\]

\end_inset

for all numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Such ordered pairs are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equivalent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formal way to write the tensor product is as a quotient over this equivalenc
e.
 This is conventionally written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U\otimes W=U\times W/\sim
\]

\end_inset

which is meant to denote the set of all equivalent ordered pairs.
 In set notation,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u\otimes w=\left\{ \mbox{all pairs }\left(s,t\right)\mbox{ such that }\left(s,t\right)=\left(u,w\right)+\left(cu,-cw\right)\mbox{ for some const }c\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

This is to be read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the set of all pairs to which we have added the equivalent of zero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Formally, the set on the right is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coset
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 By treating all members of this coset as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equivalent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forget
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 their identity and uniqueness (stemming from their origins as Cartesian
 pairs), and treat them as being all the same.
 Choosing any one exemplar from the coset will do; it is a form of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forgetting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of differences, or an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

erasure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of origins.
 It is a denial of identity politics, it is a certain racial homogenization,
 it is a democratic notion that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all are created equal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tensor products as concatenation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above was needlessly complicated.
 There is a wildly simpler way of saying the same thing, which, remarkably,
 arrives at the same place.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 be a function of variables 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z$
\end_inset

 which are understood to be ordinal numbers, that is, integers.
 Without any further restrictions (for the moment, as we ignore change-of-basis,
 for now), the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 is a tensor, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z$
\end_inset

 are the tensor indexes.
 Given another function aka tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(s,t\right)$
\end_inset

, the tensor product is simple the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(x,y,z,s,t\right)=F\left(x,y,z\right)G\left(s,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

where the product is simply the scalar product.
 This seems almost trivial in it's definition – how hard can a scalar product
 be? Its just the ordinary multiplication of numbers.
 This seems effectively trivial, but it hides a bit of trickery: there's
 a sleight-of-hand.
 The tensor on the left-hand side is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(x,y,z,s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 and not as 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(\left(x,y,z\right),\left(s,t\right)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If we look at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 as two ordered lists, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z,s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the concatenation of those lists.
 It is NOT the Cartesian product of them!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always, let's belabor the painfully obvious:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(x,y,z,s,t\right)\ne\left(x,y,z\right)\times\left(s,t\right)=\left(\left(x,y,z\right),\left(s,t\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

The right side is a list.
 The left side is a list of lists.
 List concatenation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

erases
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the nested parenthesis that appear on the right-hand-side.
 It 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forgets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where the indexes came from.
 Indeed, it might have been the case that the list was the result of concatenati
ng 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z,s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 – we simply don't know, we forgot this bit of information.
 We 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

erased
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it, the origins have been 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

democratized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: we only have a list 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z,s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 but know not whence it came.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the correspondence, list concatenation can also be written
 with an equivalence principle.
 Using the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 to denote 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same as
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(x,y,z\right)\times\left(s,t\right)\sim\left(x,y\right)\times\left(z,s,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

Using the equivalence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 to write a quotient space of concatenated products requires the development
 of some additional notion.
 This is partly undertaken in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This works for conventional tensors because 
\begin_inset Formula $F,G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 are considered to be maps to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

numbers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, elements of a field or maybe a ring.
 The multiplication of numbers (members of a field or ring) is also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forgetful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: when we write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

42
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we don't know if it was constructed from the product of 6 and 7, or from
 the product of 2 and 21.
 It could have been either of these, or yet more.
 To put it differently, if 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(a,b,c\right)=6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(d,e\right)=7$
\end_inset

 for fixed constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d,e$
\end_inset

, and we construct the product 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(a,b,c,d,e\right)=F\left(a,b,c\right)G\left(d,e\right)$
\end_inset

, we no longer know where the 42 came from.
 It might have come from 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(a,b,c,d,e\right)=H\left(a,b\right)K\left(c,d,e\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(a,b\right)=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K\left(c,d,e\right)=21$
\end_inset

.
 The forgetfulness of list concatenation goes hand-in-hand with the forgetfulnes
s of multiplication in fields and rings.
 Tensors work because the exploit both of these properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Cartesian products and lambda calculus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simply-typed lambda calculus is famously the internal language of Cartesian-
closed categories.
 Let's take a moment to unpack that statement.
 The treatment here is a bit informal; our goal is not to teach category
 theory.
 Consider a class 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of symbols.
 We call it a class because it could be a finite set, or an infinite set;
 it may be uncountable, or it may be so horridly structured that it cannot
 be expressed as a set.
 For the purposes of comp sci, things are always finite, co calling it a
 class 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is merely conventional.
 The elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

symbols
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because, for the purposes here, symbols, and the connotation that they
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stand for something
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is an important property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cartesian product of elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is an ordered list: we already wrote above that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\times b\times c=\left(a,b,c\right)$
\end_inset

 is two different ways of writing the same thing.
 It is convenient to drop the commas, and write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b,c\right)=\left(a\;b\;c\right)$
\end_inset

 as is standard in Lisp-dialect programming languages.
 Of course, one can likewise construct lists-of-lists, and so on.
 Consider now the collection (class) of all such nested lists-of-lists-of-lists...
 A typical exemplar might look like
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(a\;b\;\left(c\;d\right)\;e\;\left(f\;g\;\left(h\left(j\left(k\left(m\right)\right)\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

whence the acronym LISP - 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lots of InsidiouS Parenthesis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from.
 Here, the letters were taken to be symbols drawn from the class 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 It is, however, convenient to introduce the notion of variables; for these,
 we write 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z,\cdots$
\end_inset

 as always, by convention.
 One can then consider the class of lists with embeded variables in them.
 OK, but things really get interesting when one then considers replacing
 variables by values.
 To do this, the special notation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is introduced, and one conventionally writes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\lambda x.A\right)B\to A\left[x:=B\right]
\]

\end_inset

where both 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are lists (possibly containing variables), and the expression on the left-hand
 side of the arrow is a lambda-binding of the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 such that any occurrence of the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the list 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is to be replaced by the list 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 By convention, that is what the expression on the right hand side of the
 arrow is supposed to mean.
 The arrow itself is meant to denote beta-reduction, the actual act of plugging
 in or substitution of the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 by the thing 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 that is to be plugged in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beta reduction takes actual effort and work, it is a computation problem,
 and vastly complex schemes have been developed to perform beta reduction
 rapidly.
 From the comp-sci perspective, it is a highly non-trivial process, no matter
 how obvious it may seem from the short expression above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's it.
 That's the effective definition of simply-typed lambda calculus.
 It is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

simply typed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because all members of the class 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are taken to be of the same type.
 There were only four ingredients in the construction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Cartesian product, which allows the construction of lists (and of lists
 of lists ...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The use of variables as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

placeholders
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The use of a special symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 which is used to call out or bind or name a specific variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The performance of substitution, named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta-reduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for historical reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is, of course, much more that can be said about lambda calculus; this
 hardly scratches the surface.
 But it does show the centrality of the Cartesian product to the construction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It also helps highlight just how different list concatenation is from the
 Cartesian product of lists.
 This is a source of tremendous confusion for students of engineering and
 science, and so (as always) it is worth belaboring here.
 By convention, one is introduced to the notion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional Cartesian space.
 It is a coordinate space – the points of Cartesian space are labeled by
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 coordinates, taken to be real numbers, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 taken as elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 By convention the Cartesian product of such spaces is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}\cong\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\cong$
\end_inset

 symbol denotes isomorphism.
 By convention, this works as list concatenation: if one has spatial coordinates
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 in the 3D space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the spatial coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(s,t\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

, then, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

of course
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z,s,t\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{5}=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Notationally, this is a bit unfortunate for our purposes, as it seems to
 be a form of list concatenation.
 Even worse, the right hand side is not a tensor product! Are you confused
 yet? Posed as a riddle, the solution to the riddle is to realize that when
 one writes a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ijklm}$
\end_inset

 of five indeces, these indeces are ordinal numbers: integers.
 They are not real-number-valued coordinates of Euclidean space.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 might be real, but the indexes are not.
 The abundance of notations - parenthesis of various shapes, and commas
 and what-not, can be a bit of a trap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tensor product, in general
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have enough machinery developed to allow a general definition of
 the tensor product.
 Lets return to the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(x,y,z,s,t\right)=F\left(x,y,z\right)G\left(s,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

as a simple product of 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(s,t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This time, we allow 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anything with a forgetful product
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – not numbers, but anything which can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multiplied
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 together, in some forgetful way, so that the origin of the factors is no
 longer identifiable.
 We had been previously vague as to whether the 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z,s,t$
\end_inset

 were variables or constants; we may proceed with this vagueness, except
 that now we generalize them not to be ordinals, but to be members of some
 class 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 The ordinal property of the indexes is not relevant, here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replacing numbers by things that can be forgetfully multiplied discards
 the addition of tensors.
 This, however, is an important property that we want to maintain.
 This can be done by going 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meta-mathematical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the conventional sense, and using the disjunctive-or to combine generalized
 tensors.
 The disjunctive-or is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

menu choice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pick this or pick that, pick at least one, but don't pick both
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If we have generalized tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, we can no longer write 
\begin_inset Formula $T+U$
\end_inset

 because there is no addition, but we can still combine them with disjunctive
 choice: I can present you with 
\begin_inset Formula $T\vee U$
\end_inset

 and demand that you pick either 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
 By convention, the disjunctive-or is denoted with 
\begin_inset Formula $\vee$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can still use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 symbol to write the tensor product, or one can omit it entirely, as was
 done above, when we wrote 
\begin_inset Formula $T=FG$
\end_inset

.
 It is often useful keep a tensor product symbol, but, as we've generalized,
 it's conventional to use a slightly different symbol: the ampersand 
\begin_inset Formula $\&$
\end_inset

, and so write 
\begin_inset Formula $T=F\&G$
\end_inset

.
 We now have two symbols: 
\begin_inset Formula $\&$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vee$
\end_inset

 and can ask what the algebra of these symbols is.
 Note very carefully that it is NOT the Boolean algebra.
 We have one distributive property, but not the other.
 So, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(u\vee v\right)\&w=\left(u\&w\right)\vee\left(v\&w\right)
\]

\end_inset

 is the alternate (generalized) form of the conventional distributive property
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(u+v\right)\otimes w=u\otimes w+v\otimes w
\]

\end_inset

However, the other one, that would have made things Boolean, does not hold:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(u\&v\right)\vee w\ne\left(u\&w\right)\vee\left(v\&w\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is hardly a surprise, since it is also the case that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(u\otimes v\right)+w\ne u\otimes w+v\otimes w
\]

\end_inset

which is once again obvious and trivial: tensor products do not form a Boolean
 algebra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tensor logic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To round out the algebraic constructions for the tensor product, we can
 do the same thing that was done to obtain (simply-typed) lambda calculus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Define the algebra of 
\begin_inset Formula $\&$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vee$
\end_inset

 over a class of symbols 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Introduce variables as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

placeholders
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Employ the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 to bind or call out a specific variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enable beta-reduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This glosses over the need for alpha-conversion and possibly eta-reduction.
 I will call this algebraic system 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tensor logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as I am not aware of any conventional name for it.
 It is similar to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

linear logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but is not the same, as it is missing an important ingredient, that of
 conjugation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Inner product
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tensors become interesting in engineering and science only after the addition
 of one more ingredient: the inner product.
 The inner product allows tensors to be combined by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

contracting tensor indeces
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For example, given tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ijk}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{lm}$
\end_inset

 one might consider the contraction
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{ijm}=A_{ijk}B_{km}=\sum_{k}A_{ijk}B_{km}
\]

\end_inset

where the middle expression uses the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Einstein convention
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of summing repeated indexes, whereas on the right the sum is explicit.
 For the moment, the distinction between covariant and contra-variant indeces
 will be ignored; as any discussion of change-of-basis has been ignored,
 it remains appropriate to also ignore issues of contra/covariance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototypical inner product is that of two vectors, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}=\left[a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{n}\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}=\left[b_{1},b_{2},\cdots,b_{n}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 One writes:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\left(\vec{a},\vec{b}\right)=\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}b_{n}
\]

\end_inset

For the general case, one needs only to convert notation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\left(\vec{a},\vec{b}\right)=a_{1}\&b_{1}\vee a_{2}\&b_{2}\vee\cdots\vee a_{n}\&b_{n}
\]

\end_inset

which clearly has the same form despite a vastly different interpretation
 of the symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Inner product as connection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diagrammatically, the contraction of tensor indeces was earlier depicted
 with a puzzle-shaped diagram, repeated below, with slightly different labeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename graphics/puzzle-vector.eps
	lyxscale 60
	width 45col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diagram is slightly awkward here; the upper row is meant to depict the
 two vectors, with naked, uncontracted indexes.
 The lower part depicts a scalar, with Einstein-convention repeated indexes
 that are summed over.
 The two different mating puzzle-tab shapes hint at a hidden contra/covariance.
 They are also meant to indicate compatible types.
 That is to say, the type of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 is compatible with the type of 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

, and so can be multiplied: so, they might both be numbers, or both be something
 else, as long as they can compatibly be multiplied with each-other using
 the product 
\begin_inset Formula $\&$
\end_inset

 between them.
 We return to types shortly.
 The point of the diagram is to re-assert the claim that the inner product
 is just a form of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connecting things together
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, this time made notationally explicit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Beta reduction as inner product
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier, also it was claimed that beta-reduction was a form of connecting
 things together.
 How can this be? To recap: when one plugs in 42 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(42\right)$
\end_inset

, one is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connecting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 42 to 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This is intuitively obvious, and one can even intuit how the jigsaw-puzzle
 diagram captures this idea.
 Yet it is not (yet) obviously an inner product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To demonstrate that it is, one may appeal to the most basic type theory
 to elucidate.
 Here, 42 is an exemplar of the set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

integers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

function that takes integers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They can mate together because the types are compatible.
 We can write an integer as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1\vee2\vee3\vee\cdots
\]

\end_inset

which is a menu choice - the disjoint union, again.
 It says that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you should choose either 1 or choose 2 or choose 3 ...
 but choose at least one, and chose no more than one
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, the result of plugging in is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(1\right)\vee f\left(2\right)\vee f\left(3\right)\vee\cdots
\]

\end_inset

This begins to look like an inner product; the resemblance can be completed
 by writing it as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{1}\&1\,\vee\,f_{2}\&2\,\vee\,f_{3}\&3\,\vee\cdots
\]

\end_inset

where, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}\&1=f\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 is how one writes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 at one can be obtained by mating together the value one, as a jigsaw-puzzle-tab
, with 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the corresponding matching jigsaw-puzzle mate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 With the revised notation, its now clear that beta-reduction is a form
 of the inner product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To write it this way, there was a slight abuse of the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\&$
\end_inset

.
 Previously, it was defined as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product of two things of the same type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; yet here it is used to denote 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the mating of matching types
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is convenient to read it both ways; for the moment we sweep this under
 the rug, along with the co/contravariance issue.
 They are not entirely unrelated.
